# Broken Product-Type Filter Detector — Google Ads Script

Detects when a **Performance Max** or **Standard Shopping** product filter has silently broken because a category was **renamed or moved** in the feed — the classic failure where a `product_type`-based Asset Group / Listing Group filter starts matching **0 products** and that segment quietly goes to zero impressions while the campaign (and even the asset group) still shows *Enabled / Eligible*.

Read-only: the script **never changes** anything in the Google Ads account. It only writes to a Google Sheet and sends email.

---

## The problem

Campaigns are segmented by `product_type` (mirroring the site's category tree). When the client renames or re-nests a category, the `product_type` string in the feed changes, but the filter pinned to the **old** string does not — so it matches nothing.

Typical symptom: an asset group like `Shopping Only / Плитоноски` sits at **0 impressions, 0 clicks** with status **Eligible**, while a sibling asset group in the same campaign serves normally. Nothing in the UI looks "off". `custom_labels` can't be used to hard-pin categories (all five are used for other segmentation: sales, margins, military/civilian, etc.), so detection works off the live structure + real inventory.

---

## What it checks

The script combines a **structural (inventory)** signal with **three levels** of **traffic** signal, so the same problem is caught whether it just happened or has been dead for weeks.

| # | Signal | Source | Answers | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Inventory** | `shopping_product` | Does this filter match **0 products right now**? | Any time — independent of when it broke |
| 2 | **Asset Group / Ad Group drop** | `asset_group` / `ad_group` | Did a **whole group** stop serving (and are its filters empty)? | Fresh drop **or** long-dead |
| 3 | **Campaign drop** | `campaign` | Did a **whole campaign** dip? | Fresh drop within the window |
| 4 | **Filter drop** | `asset_group_product_group_view` / `product_group_view` | Did an **individual filter** collapse? | Fresh drop within the window |

**Inventory (1) is the reliable core.** It directly answers "0 products" and doesn't depend on traffic history, so it catches the `Eligible but 0 impressions` asset group no matter how long ago it broke.

**Group (2) is the match for the "one asset group fell out" case.** It reads impressions straight from the `asset_group` / `ad_group` resource (no fragile per-filter join), and flags a group `HIGH` when **either**:
- it had baseline traffic and dropped to 0 / steeply (a fresh drop), **or**
- it is Enabled, has **0 recent impressions**, **and** its `product_type` filters currently match **0 products** — the timing-independent case, i.e. a group that's been dead longer than the baseline window.

Each group flag is annotated with `Leaf Filters`, `Empty Leaves (0 products)`, and `Products Matching Now`, so the row itself states the cause (e.g. *"3 of 4 filters now match 0 products"*).

**Campaign (3)** catches an account-wide dip that group/filter checks would miss. **Filter (4)** is the finest granularity but depends on a cross-resource join that can be brittle for PMax — use `DEBUG` to verify it, and rely on the group/inventory checks as the robust primary.

> **Why `shopping_product`:** it returns the products Google Ads currently sees for a campaign, *including* ones that never served — unlike `shopping_performance_view`, which only lists products that got impressions. That's what makes a true "0 products" snapshot possible. Scoped per campaign, so different feeds/languages (RU `одежда` vs UK `одяг`) never cross-match.

---

## Output — Google Sheet tabs

1. **Empty Filters Snapshot** — filters matching 0 products (HIGH) or matching products that are all out of stock (REVIEW), right now. `Run Date, Channel, Confidence, Campaign, Asset Group / Ad Group, Product Type Path, Depth, Products Matching, Products Eligible, Issue`.
2. **Asset Group Anomalies** — groups that stopped serving, annotated with how many of their filters are empty. `… Baseline Impr, Recent Impr, Drop %, Leaf Filters, Empty Leaves (0 products), Products Matching Now, Issue`.
3. **Traffic Anomalies** — individual filters that collapsed, annotated with current inventory.
4. **Campaign Anomalies** — campaign-level dips.
5. **Run History** — one row per run with aggregate counters for every signal (`Inv HIGH/REVIEW, Filter Anom HIGH/REVIEW, Group Anom HIGH/REVIEW, Camp Anom HIGH/REVIEW, Total Flags`). Chart it to see trend over time.
6. **Recurring Breakages** — rebuilt each run from the Snapshot tab: which `Campaign → Group → Product Type Path` combos were flagged across **multiple runs**, sorted by frequency. Surfaces categories that break again and again.

An **email** is sent when issues are found. By default it's kept lean — only **broken filters (HIGH)** and **campaign traffic drops**, plus a prominent link to the full Sheet (which still logs *everything*: REVIEW items, group drops, filter drops, history, recurrence). Email content is fully configurable (see [Email content](#email-content)).

Confidence levels: **HIGH** = broken (0 products / dropped to 0). **REVIEW** = worth a look (products exist but all out of stock, or a steep partial drop).

---

## Confidence & which tab catches your case

- **Asset group `Eligible` but `0 impressions` (like `Плитоноски`)** → **Empty Filters Snapshot** (always) **and** **Asset Group Anomalies** (via the timing-independent branch). If the group only recently dropped, it also appears in the drop-based part of the group tab.
- **A whole campaign dipped** → **Campaign Anomalies**.
- **A single listing-group filter within an otherwise-fine group** → **Traffic Anomalies** (fresh drop) and/or **Empty Filters Snapshot** (if it matches 0 products).

If a group shows `0 impressions` but its filters still match products (`Empty Leaves = 0`), the cause is **not** a broken filter — look at bidding / budget / ad strength / disapprovals instead. The tool intentionally does **not** flag that as a broken filter.

---

## Requirements

- Google Ads account with Performance Max and/or Standard Shopping campaigns linked to Merchant Center.
- Access to **Google Ads Scripts** (Tools → Bulk actions → Scripts).
- `shopping_product` must be queryable via `AdsApp.search` in your account — **verify once** with the snippet in [Validate `shopping_product`](#validate-shopping_product).

---

## Setup

1. Google Ads → **Tools → Bulk actions → Scripts → `+` New script**.
2. Paste [`broken_filter_detector_combined.js`](./broken_filter_detector_combined.js).
3. Edit the `SETTINGS` block ([Configuration](#configuration)). At minimum set `EMAIL`. Leave `SPREADSHEET_URL` as the placeholder to auto-create a sheet on first run (URL is logged + emailed), or paste an existing sheet URL.
4. **Authorize** and grant access.
5. **Preview / Run** once. Check **Logs**. For the first run, set `DEBUG: true` to see per-group / per-filter baseline & recent numbers.
6. **Schedule** it (daily, or a few times a day — the run is cheap). You can run cheaper checks more often by toggling the `ENABLE_*` flags.

> **MCC / multiple accounts:** wrap the body of `main()` in a loop over `MccApp.accounts().get()` calling `MccApp.select(account)` per account.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in the `SETTINGS` block at the top of the script.

### General
| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SPREADSHEET_URL` | `INSERT_SPREADSHEET_URL` | Target sheet. Placeholder → auto-creates one. |
| `INVENTORY_TAB` / `ANOMALY_TAB` / `GROUP_ANOMALY_TAB` / `CAMPAIGN_ANOMALY_TAB` / `HISTORY_TAB` / `RECURRING_TAB` | tab names | Sheet tab names. |
| `EMAIL` | `INSERT_EMAIL` | Recipient(s), comma-separated. |
| `EMAIL_ONLY_WHEN_ISSUES` | `true` | `false` = always send a run summary. |
| `INCLUDE_PMAX` / `INCLUDE_SHOPPING` | `true` | Which channels to scan. |
| `DEBUG` | `false` | Log baseline/recent impressions & empty-leaf counts per filter, group, and campaign. |

### Email content
The Google Sheet always logs **everything**; these flags only control what the *email* contains.

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `EMAIL_ONLY_WHEN_ISSUES` | `true` | `false` = always send, even with nothing to report. Gated on what the email will actually show. |
| `EMAIL_SHOW_INVENTORY` | `true` | Include the Empty Filters Snapshot section. |
| `EMAIL_INVENTORY_HIGH_ONLY` | `true` | Show only HIGH (0-products) rows; skip REVIEW (out-of-stock). |
| `EMAIL_SHOW_CAMPAIGN_DROPS` | `true` | Include campaign traffic drops. |
| `EMAIL_SHOW_GROUP_DROPS` | `false` | Include asset group / ad group drops. |
| `EMAIL_SHOW_FILTER_DROPS` | `false` | Include individual filter drops. |

Default email = **broken filters (HIGH)** + **campaign drops** + **a link to the full report**.

### Formatting
| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_FORMATTING` | `true` | Colour the sheet after each run (header, HIGH/REVIEW highlight, zebra, run-date separators). |

Colours live in the `STYLE` object near the top of the script (change without touching logic):
- **HIGH** rows — loud red fill + red confidence badge, so criticals pop instantly.
- **REVIEW** rows — deliberately pale, so they don't distract from HIGH.
- **Zebra** striping on neutral rows; **dark header**, frozen.
- **Run-date separators** — a blue top border between runs; repeated dates within a run are muted so blocks read as groups.
- **Run History / Recurring** — HIGH counts in red (zeros muted), Total Flags / Times Flagged bold; frequently-recurring paths (≥3 runs) get a red badge.

Formatting re-applies over the whole tab each run using batched calls. On very large logs you can turn it off to save execution time.

### Inventory (structural)
| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_INVENTORY` | `true` | Turn the 0-products check on/off. |
| `FLAG_ALL_OUT_OF_STOCK` | `true` | REVIEW when a path has products but **none are in stock** (a real, actionable problem). Uses `shopping_product.availability`. |
| `FLAG_ZERO_ELIGIBLE` | `false` | REVIEW when a path has products but none are `ELIGIBLE`. **Noisy** — also fires on intentionally-excluded combos — so off by default. |
| `IGNORE_CAMPAIGNS_CONTAINING` | `[]` | Skip inventory rows for campaigns whose name contains any of these substrings (case-insensitive). |
| `IGNORE_GROUPS_CONTAINING` | `[]` | Skip inventory rows for asset groups / ad groups whose name contains any of these substrings. |
| `NORMALIZE_PRODUCT_TYPE` | `true` | Match `product_type` case- and whitespace-insensitively (feed has mixed case, e.g. `ліхтарі` vs `Ліхтарі`). |

### Traffic — per-filter
| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_TRAFFIC_ANOMALY` | `true` | On/off. |
| `BASELINE_DAYS` | `14` | "Was working" baseline window (shared by all traffic checks). |
| `RECENT_DAYS` | `2` | Recent check window (shared). |
| `EXCLUDE_TODAY` | `true` | Skip today's partial stats (shared). |
| `MIN_BASELINE_IMPRESSIONS` | `50` | Ignore low-volume filters. |
| `FLAG_STEEP_DROP` | `true` | Also flag partial drops (not only →0). |
| `FILTER_DROP_PCT` | `0.70` | Flag a filter if its daily rate fell by more than this (`0.70` = −70%). |

### Traffic — per-asset-group / ad-group
| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_GROUP_ANOMALY` | `true` | On/off. **This is the check for the "one group fell out" case.** |
| `GROUP_MIN_BASELINE_IMPRESSIONS` | `50` | Ignore low-volume groups (for the drop-based branch). |
| `GROUP_DROP_PCT` | `0.70` | Flag a group if its daily rate fell by more than this. |

### Traffic — per-campaign
| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_CAMPAIGN_ANOMALY` | `true` | On/off. |
| `CAMPAIGN_MIN_BASELINE_IMPRESSIONS` | `200` | Ignore tiny campaigns. |
| `CAMPAIGN_DROP_PCT` | `0.30` | Flag a campaign if its daily rate fell by more than this. |

### History & recurrence
| Setting | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ENABLE_HISTORY` | `true` | Append a counters row every run. |
| `ENABLE_RECURRING` | `true` | Rebuild the recurring-breakages tab. |
| `RECURRING_MIN_RUNS` | `2` | Only list paths flagged in at least this many distinct runs. |

Baseline and recent windows are **non-overlapping** by design (baseline = the period it was working, recent = the period being checked).

## How it works (internals)

1. **Collect filters.** Reads `asset_group_listing_group_filter` (PMax) and `product_group_view` (Shopping) for **every** enabled serving leaf (`UNIT_INCLUDED` / `UNIT`), not only ones whose own dimension is `product_type`. It rebuilds each leaf's **inherited** `product_type` path (`L1 > L2 > …`) by walking parent subdivisions — so a leaf split by *brand* (or an *"Everything else"* node) sitting under `product_type` subdivisions is still checked against its inherited category. Leaves with no `product_type` ancestor are skipped; duplicate group+path leaves are de-duplicated. Each filter carries its group id for group-level rollups.
2. **Read inventory per campaign.** For each campaign, queries `shopping_product` scoped to it and counts products per `product_type` **prefix**, so any filter depth can be matched directly. Per-campaign scoping keeps feeds/languages separate.
3. **Inventory flags.** Filter matches 0 products → HIGH (renamed/moved). Products exist but all out of stock → REVIEW (via `shopping_product.availability`; probed once and skipped gracefully if unsupported). Rows for ignored campaigns/groups are skipped.
4. **Group check.** Pulls `asset_group` / `ad_group` impressions for baseline & recent, rolls up each group's empty-filter count from step 2, and flags drops **and** timing-independent "Enabled + 0 impressions + empty filters".
5. **Campaign & filter checks.** Same baseline/recent comparison at their granularity.
6. **Write & alert.** Appends to the four flag tabs, writes Run History, rebuilds Recurring Breakages, sends email.

---

## Assumptions & limitations

- **Inherited product_type path.** The tool matches each serving leaf against the `product_type` path inherited from its ancestor subdivisions. This correctly catches the common case where an asset group subdivides by `product_type` and the serving leaf is a *brand* / *"Everything else"* node (e.g. `All products › додаткове спорядження › ліхтарі › Brand: Everything else`).
- **Out-of-stock REVIEW is product_type-scoped, not brand-scoped.** "All out of stock" is evaluated across every product under the inherited product_type path in that campaign, not per brand. So if one brand's items are sold out but another brand of the same type is in stock, it won't flag. This keeps noise down and doesn't affect rename/move detection.
- **`shopping_product.availability`.** Required for the out-of-stock REVIEW. The script probes for it once; if the field isn't exposed in your Scripts environment, that REVIEW is disabled automatically (HIGH detection is unaffected).
- **Brand-specific leaves.** If a leaf pins a *specific* brand under a product_type, the check looks only at the inherited product_type path, not the brand×type intersection — so a product_type that still has products but not for that brand won't be flagged. This does not affect category rename/move detection (when a path empties, all leaves under it — including brand ones — go to 0).
- **Exact string match.** A filter matches inventory by the **exact** `product_type` string per level. If the filter value and the feed value differ only in **case or whitespace**, it reads as 0. If the first run produces suspiciously many flags, add `trim().toLowerCase()` normalization to both the product levels (`getCampaignInventory`) and the filter values (`buildPath`).
- **Per-filter join.** The finest (filter-level) traffic check relies on joining `asset_group_product_group_view` to the listing-group filter; this can be brittle for PMax. The **group-level** and **inventory** checks don't use that join and are the robust primary signals. Use `DEBUG` to confirm the per-filter join in your account (if every filter shows `base=0`, the join isn't matching — rely on group/inventory).
- **`shopping_product` availability.** If it isn't exposed in your Scripts environment, run the equivalent logic via the Google Ads API. Validate first (below).
- **Single account.** Wrap in an MCC iterator for multiple accounts.
- Not legal/financial/marketing advice; validate against your own account before acting on flags.

## Validate `shopping_product`

Paste into a temporary script and **Preview**. If rows print with `productTypeLevel*` and `status`, you're good.

```javascript
var q = "SELECT shopping_product.item_id, shopping_product.status, shopping_product.availability, " +
        "shopping_product.product_type_level1, shopping_product.product_type_level2 " +
        "FROM shopping_product LIMIT 20";
var rows = AdsApp.search(q);
while (rows.hasNext()) { Logger.log(JSON.stringify(rows.next())); }
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| Asset group is `Eligible` but `0 impressions`, yet nothing in **Traffic Anomalies** | Expected — anomaly tabs catch a *drop within the window*. A long-dead group has a 0 baseline, so there's no drop to detect. It appears in **Empty Filters Snapshot** and **Asset Group Anomalies** instead. |
| **Traffic Anomalies** always empty, `DEBUG` shows `base=0` for every filter | The per-filter PMax join isn't matching in your account. Rely on the **group** + **inventory** checks (they don't use that join). |
| Too many `HIGH` inventory flags on first run | Case/whitespace mismatch between filter values and feed — add normalization (see limitations). |
| `shopping_product` query throws | Resource not available in Scripts for your account/version → use the API, or confirm Merchant Center is linked. |
| Group shows 0 impressions but `Empty Leaves = 0` and isn't flagged | Correct — its filters still match products, so it's not a broken filter. Investigate bids / budget / ad strength / disapprovals. |
| No anomaly flags ever | Thresholds too strict / windows too short — lower `*_DROP_PCT` or `*_MIN_BASELINE_IMPRESSIONS`, widen `BASELINE_DAYS`. |
| Asset group at 0 impressions **not** flagged, but its serving leaf is a *brand* / *"Everything else"* node | Fixed in v4 — the tool now checks every serving leaf against its **inherited** product_type path. Ensure you're on the latest script. |
| Lots of REVIEW rows for deliberately-excluded brand/type combos | Expected before v6. Now REVIEW = *all out of stock* only (`FLAG_ALL_OUT_OF_STOCK`); the noisy 0-eligible check is off (`FLAG_ZERO_ELIGIBLE: false`). Still noisy? Add the campaign/group name to `IGNORE_CAMPAIGNS_CONTAINING` / `IGNORE_GROUPS_CONTAINING`. |
| No out-of-stock REVIEW ever appears | `shopping_product.availability` may be unavailable in your Scripts env — the log notes this and the check auto-disables. Verify with the availability snippet below. |
| Real 0-product filter missed only because of casing (`ліхтарі` vs `Ліхтарі`) | Keep `NORMALIZE_PRODUCT_TYPE: true` (default) so matching is case/space-insensitive. |
| Script timeout on large accounts | Split by channel or run different `ENABLE_*` checks on separate schedules. |

## Permissions & safety

Read-only. The script uses only `AdsApp.search` (GAQL SELECT queries) against Google Ads — no `mutate`, no bulk uploads, no bid/status/structure changes. The only writes are to a **Google Sheet** and **email**. For extra assurance on client accounts, run it under a Google Ads user with a **read-only** role.

## Files

- `broken_filter_detector_combined.js` — the script (inventory + group + campaign + filter checks, history, recurrence).
- `README.md` — this file.

## Changelog

- **v6** — REVIEW now means **all out of stock** (`FLAG_ALL_OUT_OF_STOCK`, via `shopping_product.availability`, probed & graceful) instead of the noisy 0-eligible check (now `false` by default), which fired on intentionally-excluded combos. Added `IGNORE_CAMPAIGNS_CONTAINING` / `IGNORE_GROUPS_CONTAINING` to suppress deliberate service structures.
- **v5** — Sheet **formatting**: HIGH rows highlighted red, REVIEW kept pale, zebra striping, dark frozen header, run-date separators, and coloured counters in History/Recurring. Palette in the `STYLE` object; toggle via `ENABLE_FORMATTING`.
- **v4** — Collect **every** serving leaf and match on the **inherited** product_type path (catches brand / "Everything else" leaves under product_type subdivisions). Added case/whitespace **normalization** (`NORMALIZE_PRODUCT_TYPE`) and group+path de-duplication. Made the **email configurable** (`EMAIL_SHOW_*`, `EMAIL_INVENTORY_HIGH_ONLY`) — default email now sends only broken filters (HIGH) + campaign drops, with a prominent link to the full Sheet.
- **v3** — Added **per-asset-group / ad-group** anomaly tab, including a timing-independent branch that catches Enabled groups sitting at 0 impressions with empty filters. Added **per-campaign** anomaly tab. Made drop thresholds intuitive (`*_DROP_PCT`). Added `DEBUG`.
- **v2** — Added **Run History** and **Recurring Breakages** tabs.
- **v1** — Inventory (0-products) snapshot + per-filter traffic anomaly.
